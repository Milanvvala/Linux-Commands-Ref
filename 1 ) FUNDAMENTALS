1 ) FUNDAMENTALS


1.1 ) Linux over Windows

      Cost-Effectiveness
      - Free and Open Source: Linux does not require expensive licensing fees, making it a cost-effective choice for companies.
      - Lower Maintenance Costs: Linux is stable and requires minimal maintenance, reducing operational expenses.

      Performance and Efficiency
      - Better Resource Utilization: Linux is lightweight and consumes fewer system resources compared to Windows.
      - High Scalability: Linux efficiently scales from small embedded systems to enterprise data centers without performance degradation.

      Security and Reliability
      - Less Vulnerable to Malware: Linux has strong user privilege separation, making it more secure against viruses and malware.
      - Frequent and Transparent Updates: Regular security patches ensure system stability without requiring frequent reboots.
      - High Stability: Linux systems can run for years without crashes, ensuring better uptime and reliability.

1.2 ) Core components of a Linux Machine

      +----------------------------------------------------+
      | User Applications (Vim, Docker, Apache, etc.)     |
      +----------------------------------------------------+
      | Shell (Bash, Zsh, Fish, etc.)                     |  <-- Part of the OS
      +----------------------------------------------------+
      | System Libraries (glibc, libc, OpenSSL, etc.)     |  <-- Part of the OS
      +----------------------------------------------------+
      | System Utilities (ls, grep, systemctl, etc.)      |  <-- Part of the OS
      +----------------------------------------------------+
      | Linux Kernel (Process, Memory, FS, Network)       |  <-- Core of the OS
      +----------------------------------------------------+
      | Hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network, Peripherals)   |
      +----------------------------------------------------+

      (a) Hardware Layer
      The physical components of the computer (CPU, RAM, disk, network interfaces, etc.).
      The OS interacts with hardware using device drivers.

      (b) Kernel (Core of Linux OS)

      The Linux Kernel is responsible for directly managing system resources, including:
          Process Management – Schedules processes and handles multitasking.
          Memory Management – Allocates and deallocates RAM efficiently.
          Device Drivers – Acts as an interface between software and hardware.
          File System Management – Manages how data is stored and retrieved.
          Network Management – Handles communication between systems.

      (c) Shell (Command Line Interface - CLI)
      A command interpreter that allows users to interact with the kernel.
      Examples: Bash, Zsh, Fish, Dash, Ksh.
      Converts user commands into system calls for the kernel.

      (d) User Applications
      End-user programs like web browsers, text editors, DevOps tools, etc.
      Applications interact with the OS using system calls via the shell or GUI.

1.3 ) Linux Distributions

      Linux distributions (distros) are different versions of Linux that package the Linux kernel with various software, system utilities, and package managers. Each distro is designed for different use cases, such as personal computing, server management, or security.

      Here are some popular Linux distributions:
          Ubuntu – One of the most beginner-friendly distros, widely used for personal and server use. It has great community support.
          CentOS (discontinued, replaced by AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux) – Previously a popular choice for servers, based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).
          Debian – A very stable and reliable distro, often used as a base for other distros like Ubuntu.
          Fedora – A cutting-edge distro that introduces new features before they reach RHEL.
          Arch Linux – A lightweight, rolling-release distro for advanced users who like customization.
          Kali Linux – Designed for cybersecurity and penetration testing.
          Alpine Linux – A lightweight, security-focused distro often used in containers.

	Security Best Practices:
	1. Use SSH keys instead of passwords
	2. Disable root SSH login
	3. Use strong passphrases for keys
	4. Regular system updates
	5. Remove unused packages
	6. Verify package signatures

1.4 ) Setup Linux Environment on Windows and MacOS
      There are multiple ways to setup a Linux environment on a Windows or Mac machines such as cloud vm, wsl2, virtualbox, Hyperkit e.t.c.,. However what I would recommend is using a container as a Linux environment.
      Just install Docker desktop, run the below command and create linux container of any distribution without worrying about the cost and connectivity issues.
      Docker Command to Run Ubuntu Linux Container in windows host (Persistent & Long-Term)
      - Create a folder with name ubuntu-data in your downloads folder.
      - Then run the below command in poweshell updating your username.

      docker run -dit `
        --name ubuntu-container `
        --hostname ubuntu-dev `
        --restart unless-stopped `
        --cpus="2" `
        --memory="4g" `
        --mount type=bind,source="C:/Users/Monica Korla/Downloads/ubuntu-container",target=/data `
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock `
        -p 2222:22 `
        -p 8080:80 `
        --env TZ=Asia/Kolkata `
        --env LANG=en_US.UTF-8 `
        ubuntu:latest /bin/bash

      Docker Command to Run Ubuntu Linux Container in mac or linux host (Persistent & Long-Term)

      docker run -dit \
        --name ubuntu-container \
        --hostname ubuntu-dev \
        --restart unless-stopped \
        --cpus="2" \
        --memory="4g" \
        --mount type=bind,source=/tmp/ubuntu-data,target=/data \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        -p 2222:22 \
        -p 8080:80 \
        --env TZ=Asia/Kolkata \
        --env LANG=en_US.UTF-8 \
        ubuntu:latest /bin/bash

      Explanation of Each Parameter

      -----------|-------------
      -dit | Runs the container in detached (-d), interactive (-i), and terminal (-t) mode.
      --name ubuntu-container | Assigns a name to the container for easy management.
      --hostname ubuntu-dev | Sets the container's hostname.
      --restart unless-stopped | Ensures the container restarts automatically unless manually stopped.

      --mount type=bind,source=C:/ubuntu-data,target=/data | Mounts a folder from Windows into the container to persist data.
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock | Allows running Docker commands inside the container (optional).
      -p 2222:22 | Maps port 2222 on the host to 22 (SSH) inside the container.
      -p 8080:80 | Maps port 8080 on the host to 80 (for web services).
